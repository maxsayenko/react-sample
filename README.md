# react-sample
Goals for this test project:
* Use ES6 / Babel
* Webpack
* Make something that's a viable foundation for a larger Collection management tool (not a throw-away)
* Complete Flux implementation
* Play with inlining css (completely stand-alone components)
* Lay foundation for isomorphic rendering using Redux later on
